This is just a simple ERC20 token that I created based off of "openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol" and deployed in order to learn more about how tokens work and are created.

You can see the token's contract at https://kovan.etherscan.io/address/0x7429c51cd331c25114A54A823e2142D922e30bc8

The symbol for the token is $DNRT and it literally does nothing in this version other than be a token
