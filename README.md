# SolidityAndPythonPractice

PracticeDeployAndInteractWithPython is code writen by following the Solidity, Blockchain, and Smart Contract Course â€“ Beginner to Expert Python Tutorial. Currently it includes creating a basic contract, deploying that contract to a testnet and invoking functions on that contract to both retrieve state and update state.

# BrownieExamples 
Contains code working with deploying and interacting with smart contracts via brownie. Also, using brownie to unit test contracts. 

- FundMe example is just a smart contract that accepts a payment and allows withdraw to the owner

# ERC20 Token
Just deploying a basic ERC20 token so I can see what goes into it. Nothing fancy here

# Smart Contract Lottery
This lottery example allows users to enter a lotto, then uses a chainlink contract in order to get a random number, then the Lotto smart contract I deployed picks a winner using this random number.
